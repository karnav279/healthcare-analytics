#This text file has the instructions on how to run the codes to run the model

Please following the following steps:

1.) Before executing any codes first thing to do is download following packages using following codes in R console or R Studio:

install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)

install.packages("tree")
library(tree)

install.packages("boot")
library(boot)

install.packages("datasets")
library(datasets)

install.packages("e1071")
library(e1071)

install.packages("factoextra")
library(factoextra)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)

install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

install.packages("leaps")
library(leaps)

install.packages("class")
library(class)

install.packages("car")
library(car)


2.) Download the cleaned data file that has all the NA values replaced and where the lags have also been added. The name of this file is 'trainData_Clean.xlsx' and we want to use 'completeData_Clean' sheet sheet. Now, set up working directory using the code:

setwd("folder path where your file is stored") and then follow the set of codes provided in the R file: "project_code.R"
